You have to put your text in text.txt file.

You have to put your pattern in pattern.txt file.

Those pattern.txt and text.txt files should be in a same location with python file.

Good Luck :)

Pattern can be included 

	^ -> starts with
	$ -> ends with
	. -> any character without \n (new line)
	| -> Either or
	\d-> digits (0-9)

Other characters will be taken in the context as normal characters.
