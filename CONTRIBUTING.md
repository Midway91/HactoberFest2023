# Contributing

## Guidelines

- **No deleting files**
- Your code doesn't have to be pretty
- You can use any language
- If there isn't a folder for the language that you are using then make a folder in the HactoberFest folder with the name of the language
- Have fun!

## Making Contributions

Be sure to look for similar ideas you may have that already exist within the repository. Avoid making duplicates of issues or Pull Requests when you can. With that in mind, here are 6 simple steps you need to do to contribute.

1. Fork this repository

At the top right corner of the Github repository, there will be a button that says `fork`. After clicking it, there will be a green button that creates the fork.

2. Clone your fork of this repository

Now, you should have a new repository in your repo panel in the form of `<your-username>/HACTOBERFEST2023`. From a terminal, run these commands to clone this repository and enter it.

```sh
git clone https://<your-username>/HACTOBERFEST2023
cd HACTOBERFEST2023/
```

3. Create a branch

This branch is where all of your contributions for a particular feature or item will reside.

```sh
git checkout -b binary-search
```

The branch name can be anything, but ideally it should be a one to three word summary of a feature or contribution you plan to make.

4. The fun part (your contribution)

At this point, everything is setup for you to make your changes to the repository. The goal is to have fun and learn. Once you are ready to save your changes, add and commit them.

This command allows git to track your changes.

```sh
git add BinarySearch.py
```

This command commits (saves) your changes for each file specified in the command. Make sure to add a useful and informative comment to document your changes.

```sh
git commit -m "BinarySearch" BinarySearch.py
```

5. Push to origin

Make your commits visible on Github.

```sh
git push origin binary-search
```

6. Create a Pull Request

The final step is to create a Pull Request. This allows your changes to be reviewed, commented on, and accepted. From your forked repository on Github, click the `New Pull Request` button at the top of your repository page. Add a fitting title and write an informative description about the changes you made.

At this point your work is done! Give yourself a pat on the back and wait for your PR (Pull Request) to be reviewed and accepted. Happy Coding :)
