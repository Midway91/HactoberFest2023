## Problem statement
In-app nudges provide non-intrusive guides for various features of a mobile app. Setting up
tooltips will help draw attention to a given element on the screen.
## Instructions
Build a frontend app that renders a tooltip with dynamic positioning, style and text. Include
a live preview of the tooltip being rendered. Use React.js / Next.js for building the app. Build
the tooltip component without the use of additional libraries.

## Must Haves
- Ability to set the target element, position (top/right/bottom/left), style and text of
the tooltip
- A real-time preview of a mobile screen with button elements. (These buttons will act
as the target elements for the tooltip to be rendered)
- The tooltip component should be built and positioned without using any additional
library
